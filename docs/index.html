                Rohingya refugee camps are some of the most populated refugee camps in the world, with over 700,000 people fleeing from Myanmar into Bangladesh as of September 2018. Most of these refugees are located in Kutapalong Camp, which with a population over 500,000 people makes it the world's largest refugee camp.

                Living in cramped quarters, NGOs have stated that the current facilities are overtaxed by the growing population and inadeuete to meet current needs. The close quarters of camps have potential health outbreak consequences, while current sanitation facilities are woefully inadequete to cope with the influx of refugees and the growing population. <br>

                The above map shows population density of the main Kutapalong camp. Kutapalong accounts for more than half the refugee population in Bangladesh. In some camps population density in some camps are more than 80 people per square kilometer. Equivalent to the population density of the United States. In some camps, refugees have only 10 square meters per person. <br>
                <br>
                Refugees live in close quarters in make-shift shelters made of tin, bamboo and tarp. This past November, Bangladesh delayed sending refugees back to Myanmar after intense criticism from human rights organizations. According to Daphnee Cook, communications manager of Save the Children in Cox's Bazaar, NGOs are now preparing for long-term settlement of these make-shift camps.

                 A lack of proper sanitation facilities is also a huge problem for refugee camps. In some camps, more than 240 refugees may use a single latrine facility. This raises the risk of various diseases including cholera, polio, and diarrheal-related illnesses. Accute Watery Diarrhea is the second most frequent reason refugees visted medical facilities with trailing behind respitory infection.  <br>

                According to IOM, severe funding shortages are hurting healthcare response in the refugee camps. According to Iftekar Mahmoud, director of the HOPE Foundation, doctors in Hope's facilities can expect to see around 50 patients per day. <br>
                Healthcare providers have been working pre-emptively to prevent outbreaks of diseases. This past November 330,000 refugees were vaccinated against cholera.  As of 19 November, the United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humnitarian Affairs's reported their appeal for funding was 71 per cent funded allowing for much needed funding for medical, nutrition, and sanitiation facilities.
